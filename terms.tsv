This cleft constitutes the major binding site for most ABPs and also mediates important longitudinal contacts between actin subunits in the filament

Approximately 15%–20% of all helices in protein structures are 310-helices, which are commonly found as N- or C-terminal extensions to an α-helix (Barlow and Thornton 1988). 310-Helices in proteins are typically only three to five residues long compared with a mean of 10–12 residues for α-helices (Richardson and Richardson 1988)

HBP00173	PTI-125	pmid:28438486	PTI-125 is a small molecule that preferentially binds altered FLNA and restores its native conformation, restoring receptor and synaptic activities and reducing its alpha7nAChR/TLR4 associations and downstream pathologies
HBP00174	alpha-4 beta-2 nAChR	pmid:24828779	In addition to nAChRs forming from different subunit assemblages, stoichiometric study has shown that α4β2 nAChRs can form as either (α4)3(β2)2 or (α4)2(β2)3, the latter having a greater affinity for both nicotine and Ach
HBP00175	alpha-7 beta-2 nAChR	pmid:27179601	Accumulating evidence demonstrates that these α7 and β2 nAChR subunits can co-assemble to form functional α7β2 nAChRs in heterologous expression systems, and also under natural conditions in the brain (Figure 1)
HBP00176	beta-2-containing nAChR	pmid:24828779	The β2 subunit can couple with non-α4 subunits, including α2, α3 and α6 subunits to form functionally distinct nAChRs, but these receptors are much less densely expressed in the central nervous system relative to α4β2* nAChRs (*indicating potential assemblage of β2 subunits with non-α4 subunits)

HBP00180	alpha-6-containing nAChR	pmid:28445721, pmid:19498417	alpha6-containing receptors, which in brain occur as heteropentamers with beta2 and beta3 and are especially enriched in presynaptic nerve terminals in striatum (Champtiaux et al.,2002)
HBP00181	phosphatase-activating domain	pmid:26671985, pmid:28413156	Tau domain located in the N-terminal region encompassing residues 2-18. It activates phosphatase PP1 which dephosphorylates Ser9 in GSK3Beta and leads to its activation. In normal tau, both NTD and CTD are folded back in proximity to each other forming a 'paper-clip' conformation, which masks the PAD. Phosphorylation in the AT8 epitope, disrupts this normal conformational state, exposing the PAD by moving away the terminal domains.

Alongside the LTD (long-term depression) represent the two mechanisms of memory formation and storage. Impairment of this process in AD is caused by soluble oligmoeric amyloid beta.

HBP00192	Microgliosis	pmid:29121589	An intense reaction of microglia following CNS insult, characterized by active proliferation and retracted cellular processes. In AD, accumulation of Abeta can be a possible cause of such physiological phenomenon, as microglia is seen surrounding senile plaques. Abeta interaction with microglial pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, production of toxic NOS and ROS and release of proinflammatory cytokines.
