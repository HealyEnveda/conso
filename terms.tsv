HBP00161	neurovascular unit	pmid:25136294	The brain hyperaemia, or coupling, is accomplished by a group of cells, closely related to each other; called neurovascular unit (NVU). The neurovascular unit is composed by neurones, astrocytes, endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB), myocytes, pericytes and extracellular matrix components. reference:PMID: 24629161

HBP00166	proline-rich domain	pmid:25974414, pmid:8068626, pmid:9190213	Correspounding to residues I151 to Q244 of the 441 aa tau isoform, separated into P1 and P2. Possible role in tau's functional stabilization through the reported intramolecular interaction of P2 with R1, R2 and R4 from the microtubule-binding region

HBP00169	hydrophobic pocket of actin	pmid:21314430	 The lower cleft between domains 1 and 3 is lined by residues Tyr143, Ala144, Gly146, Thr148, Gly168, Ile341, Ile345, Leu346, Leu349, Thr351, and Met355, which are predominantly hydrophobic. This cleft constitutes the major binding site for most ABPs and also mediates important longitudinal contacts between actin subunits in the filament
HBP00170	310-helix	pmid:12761385	The 310-helix is the fourth most common type of secondary structure in proteins after α-helices, β-sheets, and reverse turns (Barlow and Thornton 1988). Approximately 15%–20% of all helices in protein structures are 310-helices, which are commonly found as N- or C-terminal extensions to an α-helix (Barlow and Thornton 1988). 310-Helices in proteins are typically only three to five residues long compared with a mean of 10–12 residues for α-helices (Richardson and Richardson 1988)
